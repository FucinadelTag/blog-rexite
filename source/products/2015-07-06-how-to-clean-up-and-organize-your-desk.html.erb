<p class="abstract">What does your office desk say about you? Does a messy desktop hidden under stacks of papers imply a completely disorganized owner? Or, on the contrary, does a spotless and anonymous workplace say you are a bit of a neat freak?</p>

<p>Sometimes, we spend more time in our office than we do at home. And we must say it that our office is our second home, whether we like it or not. We can’t deny that our office reflects, even if only a small part, who we are. Creative, messy, neat or simply badly organized, our office speaks for us and says things about the way we like to work. As Jennie Dede says, vice president of recruiting for Adecco, “With so many open office plans today, more people can see into your workspace, and they do judge. It’s often personal. They think that you must be a slob in your real life.” Of course, it wouldn’t be fair to judge someone from their desk status or, even worse, undermine their career. However, still, co-workers will link a chaotic office to organization skills and assume their project will presumably get lost in the dark wood of the desk. <strong>Having a neat and well organized desk is not only important in creating a good impression with co-workers or clients, but also for you to work better, faster and in a completely different and clearer state of mind.</strong> So, are we ready to start with a whole new desk?</p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/rexite/1801804972dfa1eb47d6e47c8c89a41e6110170e_status-gruppo-comp-oro.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="495" /></p>

<p>First of all, take your waste basket and fill it with all the trash, loose paperwork and items you no longer need; this action may take some time (depending on when the last time you tidied your desk up was), but at the end of the process, you should already feel lighter. Now that your desk is empty and clean, you need to <strong>establish specific desk areas for different purposes</strong>: a workspace for your computer, a filing zone for your archives, and a storage area for writing materials. Everything on your desk requires a precise place and remember, your desktop is not a rubbish dump: “The only stuff in the radius of your arms should be the stuff you need immediately,” advises Peter Walsh. In order to better accomplish this task, we suggest that you get some <strong>desktop sets</strong>. Letter trays will help you to store all your archives neatly according to the type of document, year or source. A pencil cup on your desktop will let you easily find a pen, pencil or highlighter when urgently needed. A memo pad-holder, then a tape dispenser, because we all hate to lose the start of tape on a roll. If you have a library at your disposal or an empty wall where you can hang bookshelves, it would be a great place for all your books. At this point, you should be feeling really proud of yourself for the hard work and willpower you’ve displayed. Now you deserve to put a couple of pictures or personal items in some empty spaces in order to remember that you have a home to return to, even if your desk may seem like a zen paradise now.</p>
