<p>We can’t actually say that the Abitacolo is a bed, since it’s much, much more than that. The Abitacolo is a modular structure. It’s an intimate place for kids, an area of their house that is actually theirs. As every idea that came out of Munari’s mind, <strong>the Abitacolo has nothing to do with the ordinary</strong>, and if we wanted to define it in few words, we would call it innovative, simple, and adaptable. Even the name is evocative. In Italian, the word “abitacolo” has several meanings: &quot;abitacolo&quot; is where the pilot sits on a plane and where people ride in a car or truck. It can even be considered as an independent space where you spend your time and that you can embellish. And this is exactly the main idea behind the Abitacolo by Munari. He wanted to create a home within the home for a kid’s bedroom, where he or she could play, write, create, and of course, sleep. In our houses, particularly if they are small, we usually do not provide a space for kids. As Munari said, “In houses built for adults, children do not always have their abitacolo. The lucky ones have a bedroom of their own to furnish and decorate as they please. The less fortunate have to make do with a bed, a chair, perhaps a table and somewhere to put their books, keeping their clothes in a suitcase, as I did for a long time. They have no abitacolo where they can retire to study, meditate, read, write, sleep, listen to their own kind of music and talk to their friends”.</p>

<p>Focusing on its structure, it is a pearl-grey, epoxy-painted, steel structure, which includes two wire-net surfaces. The lower one is the support for the mattress and can be fitted with shelves, baskets, a desk, or a night table. And, just to make our kids happier, the Abitacolo is strong enough for them to climb on it! Its structure is in fact very solid, and even adults could climb on it without breaking it. The Abitacolo can, in fact, bear the weight of 20 people, though this wouldn’t be very comfortable... No wonder <strong>the Abitacolo received the design award Compasso d&#39;Oro in 1979</strong>! These are all the reasons why Rexite was really thrilled to become the official dealer for the Abitacolo in 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone should have their Abitacolo</strong>. As children, we all need sometimes our space to cool off and shut everyone out. A place for our thoughts and ideas, a place to displace our interests. A habitat to adapt to our personality.</p>
