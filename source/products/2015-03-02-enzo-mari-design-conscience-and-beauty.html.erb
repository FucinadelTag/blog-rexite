<p>Some designers are famous for a couple of items they had produced, others have had 15 minutes of fame in their whole life. Still others, very few in number, will be remembered as design milestones and masters, design theorists and practitioners. Enzo Mari belongs to this last type of designers. His planning intuition, combined with his deep knowledge of materials gave him the ability to create functional, rational products with simple but elegant designs. As Enzo Mari said &quot;<strong>For me, each design must be utilitarian, functional and do justice to the materials used as well as those involved in making them</strong>.&quot; His research for functionality hasn’t limited its creativity and experimentation: in fact, he believes that the design of a project should be beautiful to look at and feel, while performing its function efficiently. “Many of Mari&#39;s works are masterpieces - rare combinations of intellectual puzzles and beautiful lines,&quot; said the British product designer Jasper Morrison. &quot;Most designers who analyze problems to the extent that he does end up with rather dry, systemized solutions. His works are highly original and uncompromising, with a kind of poetic and heroically human touch.” Enzo Mari’s production is extremely various and generous and several of his items marked the history of the last thirty years of design, with important contributes to the world-wide debate on the profession and role of the designer within the society.</p>

<p><strong>Simplicity, rationality and versatility are 3 core values that Enzo Mari shares with Rexite.</strong> And this is why since 2013 Rexite is thrilled to produce several items designed by the great master, including bookcases Trieste and Teca, Delfina chair, Press magazine-rack and Cantina bottle-rack.</p>

<p><strong>Trieste bookcase </strong>is a clear example of Enzo Mari’s <strong>research for materials and simplicity</strong>. He combines beauty and functionality, two elements that a design project like Trieste must have in order to be appealing and useful inside a house or office. Talking about its technical features, Trieste is a wall-mount bookcase system with steel shelves, sides and uprights epoxy painted in opaque white or pearl grey. It can be extended and modernised to fit everyone’s need. Its structure is solid and stable, as Mari says: “When I create a project I always want it to last for at least 100 years or even 1000 years.”</p>
