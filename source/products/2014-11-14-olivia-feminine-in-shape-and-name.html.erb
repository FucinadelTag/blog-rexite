<p>How was a design product, like Olivia, born?</p>

<p>The creation process of a design product is always very significant, often happening by chance. The inspiration may come from art, nature, objects, our own experiences and the people around us. It is not only a specific research, but also a creative effort.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>We can easily identify three starting points for the Olivia chair: the shape of a guitar, the silhouette of a woman, and the Well Stool by Rexite.</strong></p>

<p>Raul Barbieri, the creator, took part of the inspiration for creating Olivia from the shape of a guitar: a guitar is sensual, curvy, fine and has an irresistible design. He reflected that he would have liked to play Olivia and hold it in his hands, just like a guitar. We may recall the “Guitar” by Picasso, one of the first three-dimensional assemblages accomplished through the “papier collé” technique: it actually represents the amazing “Stylistic manifesto” of Olivia.</p>

<p>The second stimulus came from the female silhouette. In the history of art, the feminine figure has always been a main theme, even if its depiction has changed drastically over centuries. </p>

<p></p>

<p>During the creation of Olivia, the shape of the seat of the Well Stool represents another starting point. <strong>The seat is rather wavy, curvy like the feminine figure and like the profile of a guitar. </strong>For this reason, Raul decided to again use these round lines. Olivia represents the progress of this stackable stool. Moreover, Raul decided to add a seatback to the stool, in order to make it more comfortable. The chair would be composed of a stool and a backrest.

<p>During the planning phase, he used several model prototypes, including sketches, small-scale prototypes and mock-ups on cardboard, using a precise technique that allowed him to represent any form.</p>

<p><strong>After several mock-ups to test technique and style, Raul successfully came up with Olivia’s shape. A unique wavy piece that merges seatback and seat. A feminine and sensual chair, exactly as he wanted it to be.</strong>
