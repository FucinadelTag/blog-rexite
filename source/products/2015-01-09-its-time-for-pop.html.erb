<p>In your entryway you may need a storage for coats, jackets and hats. And for hats. And for umbrellas too. Pop by Rexite would fulfil these duties while being a stylish piece of furniture. “<strong>The name “Pop” is inspired by pop art</strong>, the art movement that emerged in the 1950s, and so called for its popular impulse,” said Rino Pirovano, “the most suitable name for an item that mixes functional needs and artistic research without losing track of the harmonious sensuality of design.” Even for the creation of Pop Raul Barbieri found inspiration from nature: this time the impulse came from a flower. <strong>Four hooks like four flower petals</strong>. A long stalk to easily hang coats and jackets. Several colours to light up your environment. Of course, imagination and originality are the essence of design. </p>

<p>Pop production was not that easy and it took much hard teamwork between the production and design departments to work out the best process to manufacture the greatest, most functional coat stand. For instance, the hooks, made of coloured polycarbonate, are manufactured by employing an <strong>advanced technique of gas assist injection moulding</strong>. This is a low pressure process that requires the injection of pressurized nitrogen gas into the interior of a mould. The gas flows through strategically placed gas channels to displace the material in the thick areas of the part by forming hollow sections. The pressurized gas pushes the molten resin tight against the cavity walls until the part solidifies, and the constant, evenly transmitted gas pressure keeps the part from shrinking while also reducing surface blemishes, sink marks, and internal stresses. This process significantly reduces material usage while producing a part with superior structure and aesthetics. Then a steel rod finely painted with epoxy powders and a steel base with coloured engineering polymer cover are produced. If you’d like, Pop comes with an umbrella holder and drip tray, providing the full functionality for your everyday life. Of course, <strong>material knowledge and technology studies are the ABCs of design</strong>.</p>

<p>The quality of Pop is the result of several elements: as with food, raw materials must be of the finest quality. Therefore, Rexite has always paid close attention to the impact its production activities could have on people and the environment, in strict compliance with European law. This is probably why numerous realties in France, Germany and Northern Europe have often chosen Pop - and Rexite - to add style to their interiors. <strong>Pop by Rexite combines decorative authenticity with the perfect functionality you might need from a coat stand</strong>. </p>
