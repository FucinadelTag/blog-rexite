<p>If someone says Zanzibar most of people would immediately fly with their minds and hearts to white, sandy beaches, unbelievably turquoise water, and a beautifully relaxed atmosphere. Here at Rexite if you say Zanzibar we would promptly think of a unique, amazing stool made by Raul Barbieri. And not because we are eager beavers, but simply because even if Zanzibar is a relatively newbie to Rexite (in 2015 Zanzibar celebrates its 14th year), its charming and playful design caught the eye of everyone. With Zanzibar, as well as with all the other products, Raul Barbieri wanted to be as coherent as possible with Rexite’s motto: simple yet not banal, original yet not bizarre. He was looking for a precise design and shape to catch people’s attention thanks to its freshness and innovation. Raul imagined a flexible stool that could perfectly be fitted to any person and need thanks to the different adjustable heights available. He came up with an ergonomically-designed stand with no seatback, where you can seat from three different positions while maintaining the same level of comfort. In other words, an easy-to-use stool designed to fit every environment from a modern-looking kitchen island or high dining table, to a stylish bar or shop. </p>

<p>For such a uniquely sparkling stool we can’t think of a more appropriate and evocative name than Zanzibar. Zanzibar is designed keeping few words in mind: comfort, versatility, and of course design. The rest is left to creativity and imagination. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree either. The colored and irreverent Zanzibar brought with it its young brothers, colored and irreverent too: “Zanziswing”, with swinging movement to adapt to any position and “Zanziplano”, colored and cheerful tables and side tables, along with its cousins “Well” and “Welcome”, with the same ergonomic seat of their big cousin Zanzibar. Clearly, they are all made by Raul Barbieri. These are products that made, are making and will keep on making the history of Rexite. </p>

<p>Such an amazing variation of the classic and sometimes boring stool is of course subject to imitation, but Zanzibar and its heirs still remain a great piece for your modern decor. The extensive range of colors, the gas lift mechanism to easily adjust the height of the stool - everything is conceived with the smallest details firmly in mind.</p>
