<p class="abstract">Whether we like it or not, a single day doesn’t end without looking at clocks or watches at least once during our daily activities.</p>

<p>Clocks usually conform to their traditional design, but what if we try to transform clocks into design objects? Would it be possible to create an unorthodox and creative clock, without breaking away from what we consider the usual way to tell the time?</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is exactly what Rexite tried to do with the <strong>new Appuntamento wall clocks</strong>. A circle shape to follow the classic form of traditional clocks, minute and hour hands to allow easy reading of the time, as well as a pendulum to keep close to the old-fashioned pendulum clocks. The three elements of tradition are all there. So, what makes Appuntamento clocks so unconventional? <strong>Colors and creativity</strong>! At Salone del Mobile, Rexite’s secret weapon was of course the new and fresh Appuntamento line. And today, we’d like to focus on two out of the new 7 clocks: <strong>Primavera and Inverno, meaning Spring and Winter</strong>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Spring is the inevitable transformation of grey and brown fields into the fresh and green grass. That same grass will soon become the perfect habitat for blooming primulas and cyclamens. We may not like the flow of time, but when it’s time for spring, we’ll be ready for it! The Primavera wall clock plays with the theme of spring colors: green, rose and blue to create a sparkling clock that fits colorful offices, bedrooms and bars!</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then, Winter comes along. With the purest white snow, stillness and tranquility. The sober look and timeless elegance of winter is unmistakable. Indeed, the beauty of Inverno Appuntamento is the soothing grandeur, when we face the window only to see a pure layer of snow covering everything. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Primavera and Inverno wall clocks took the <strong>essential elements of two seasons</strong> to create clocks characterized by suggestive simplicity, where creativity is based on the mere play of colors. Shall we wait for Summer and Fall wall clocks by Rexite? Of course, they could not miss out during the flow of seasons, and they could not miss out in Rexite’s collection!
