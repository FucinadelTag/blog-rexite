<p>The main character of the post of today is a wastebasket. Well, not a basket like all the others, but a special one! Its name is <strong>Cribbio</strong> and <strong>since 1981 it has been the elegant interior design element that every office should have</strong>. If you are not Italian you won’t understand the reference hidden behind its name, but it’s worth a short explanation: Cribbio is actually an interjection, like “holy cow” in English, mostly used in the Milan area, but the reason why Rino Pirovano chose this word is actually different. It was the word used by Milanese bricklayers to point out the sieve used to separate the sand from stones. Pirovano’s choice of this name is a really important one, as it honors an instrument soaked with strain and Italian history. </p>

<p>Let’s talk about its properties: it is a container made in one single steel piece without welding. But this wasn’t enough, so Cribbio’s father, Raul Barbieri, decided to pierce it laterally in order to make Cribbio look more elegant and less wastebasket-like. And you must agree that it did the trick! How many times have we looked for the right wastebasket, but with scant success? Once they’re made of plastic, they look like supermarket rubbish bins. Well, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to incorporate a wastebasket into the design of a room. Cribbio is an elegant yet simple item to match every kind of office. It has rubber trim to protect it from moisture on the floor, and a painted or chrome-plated steel rod. <br>And this was only the beginning. <strong>Soon after, Cribbio had an entire family to match with</strong>: an umbrella stand (1982), a coat stand (1983) and a floor ashtray with wastebasket (1984). All members of the Cribbio family, all made by Raul Barbieri. It’s an entire set that has gradually been enriched to meet all needs. In a few years several office furniture suppliers from Italy, including Tecno, Castelli, Unifor, Faram and Estel, were queuing up to have some of these items.</p>

<p><strong>Cribbio is a relevant example of Rexite’s research of excellence in design, using the most suitable materials for a project</strong>. Cribbio makes it even clearer that we can’t simply define these items as a mere wastebasket or an umbrella stand: they’re much more. There is a story behind them, a story that is waiting for someone to listen to it.</p>
