<p>A coat stand or a coat rack is a must-have piece of furniture for an office. Why? Because no one likes to hang their dripping clothes to their chairs or on their desks before starting work. From the very first day of rain, you will understand why your purchase was not another piece of useless furniture to clutter the space in your office. Indeed, it is useful when it comes to better weather forecasts too, since hanging coats, hats, scarves, bags, and even umbrellas in one single place, will make your office tidier and neater. Once clarified its irreparable presence in every office, let’s try to understand what would be the best choice according to space and need. <strong>The 2 main options we have to hang our clothes are coat stands and coat racks.</strong> The coat stand is composed of a base, a tubular body and several hooks. It can easily be moved from one place to the other. The coat rack is composed of a central stem to be hanged to the wall or door with several hooks.</p>

<h3>CONSIDER SIZE FIRST</h3>

<p><strong>The amount of space available may determine whether you should buy a coat stand or a coat rack</strong>. Since coat racks do not require floor space, they are the right answer if your office is already packed. Instead, a coat stand is conceived to stay near the entrance without causing an obstruction: so make sure there would be enough space. Our advice is to think about the exact position where you would place it, before splurging on the wrong item.<br>Finally, the number of hooks available on a stand is important, as a large company will obviously require more hooks to store coats (and probably more coat stands) and space to accommodate all of the coats, hats, scarves, bags, and umbrellas than a person working alone. For this proposal, value also the stability and strength of your coat stand or rack so that it will bear the weight.</p>

<h3>FUNCTIONALITY OR DESIGN</h3>

<p>If we need to choose among the functionality of a piece of furniture or its value as a design object, most people would obviously choose the first one. But we mustn’t forget that looks matter, especially for furniture used daily.<strong> Try to please the eye in order to enhance our working area, keeping in mind the main role of a coat stand or rack</strong>: hang jackets without let them fall on the ground!</p>

<h3>COLORS ALSO COUNT</h3>

<p>Once decided the model you like, there still is a tough decision to make: the color. You can choose a color that coordinates with the rest of your office: a white coat stand or rack to match with your white and neat desks. But you can also choose a color that has apparently nothing to do with the rest of the furniture: what about a red element to stand out in a grey-leading environment?</p>

<h3>THE CHOICE IS YOURS</h3>

<p>A coat stand or rack is the efficient way to store clothing inside your office, but be careful during your shopping. You can find several items on the market: cheap coat racks that won’t be strong enough because of lack of quality, design coat stands which will have an annoying tendency to let your jackets fall to the ground because of lack of functionality. <strong>So make sure to mix the good amount of functionality with a design feel.</strong></p>
