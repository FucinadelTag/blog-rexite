<p>The international design week is for sure the most chaotic, delirious, and yet entertaining and fundamental week for design insiders, the event you can’t miss if you are an architect, designer, journalist or simply a design passionate. For those who weren’t there, Salone del Mobile was a great event for Rexite, too. Our stand was characterized by a <strong>sober yet dynamic atmosphere</strong>. White walls and floor were the perfect habitat to shoot colors out. Grass-green, primrose-yellow, gentian-blue and cyclamen. These will be the new gorgeous colors of Rexite for several of the core products we have produced for years: offices cry out for colors! If looking around your office the only colors you see on your right are white and black, then black and white on your left, Rexite is by contrast a rainbow of colors. Olivia chair, the Pop coat-rack, the Taboo basket, Zero wall clock and the Standard desk accessories in four brand new nuances.</p>

<p>Now, shall we talk about the amazing Appuntamento wall clocks with their sparkling names? Scaccomatto (translated in “checkmate”), Bubble, Design, Giocoliere (“Juggler”), Italy, Milleunanotte (“A thousand and one night”). A chessboard-shaped clock for Scaccomatto, colored bubbles instead of numbers for Bubble, stars, and blue sky for Milleunanotte. As we used to say, “<strong>for home, for office, for fun</strong>.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last but not least, one of the leading actors of Rexite this year is, of course, the Olivia Wood. It merges together Rexite’s passion and research for new materials with our traditional manufacture in polypropylene. In fact, the unmistakable shape of the Olivia chair brilliantly combines with the wooden legs into a fabulous result originating from the wise contrast between the two materials, wood and polypropylene. <strong>History merges with modern</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, if we need to summarize Salone del Mobile for Rexite we would say: colors, strong emotions, and fun!</p>
