<p class="abstract">Have you ever asked yourself who is behind your chair, your table, or even your pencil cup? We are talking about the hand that builds and designs your chair; the worker that assembles the base, tubes, and hooks of your coat stand; and the person that inspects the quality and integrity of every single product before it’s shipped off to consumers and retailers.</p>

<p>We wanted to find out whose hands are behind Rexite, so we spent a day trying to learn a bit more about it! <strong>We went to Rexite’s production department</strong> and met Maurizio, Antonio, Paolo, and all the other people that work at Rexite every day. Quite unexpectedly, they loved explaining the manufacturing processes to us and were eager to go into technical details about their jobs, although, admittedly, sometimes the details were too difficult for an outsider to understand.</p>

<p><strong>Everything starts with plastic granules</strong>, also known as polypropylene granules, which arrive at Rexite as tiny, milky granules of plastics. Depending on the kind needed for a particular product, the granules are colored: green for the Olivia chair, red for the Pop coat stand, and Bordeaux for the Alexa chair. Orderly stacks of paint cans wait for the production of the next green Oliva chair and so on. Maurizio is the supervisor of the molding department and was more than happy to show us how injection molding machines convert plastic granules into any product required. During our visit, one employee was working on gaskets for the Cactus coat stand, meticulously checking the quality and shape of each gasket. In the back, a 3-by-3-meter injection molding machine had just been activated to produce the hooks for the Pop coat stand: small petal-shaped plastic hooks came out of the mold and were manually plunged in cold water to prevent the hooks from deforming during cooling. Isn’t it amazing?</p>

<p>Before entering the next department, we were greeted by Paolo, who explained the shearing process to us: some materials need to be pierced, others lanced, and others are shaved, depending on the different manufacturing processes. Just consider that, in order to make a single minute hand on a Contrattempo wall clock, 7 passes are required to shape the metal!<br>Once the product is finished, the staff in the packaging department collect the single elements that compose a table or a coat stand and carefully wrap them to ensure product integrity during shipping. And that’s not all: there’s also the tooling foreman for the maintenance of every mold, the shipping department, and the quality control department. <strong>Rexite’s focus on meticulous craftsmanship has become a philosophy that makes their high-quality production process an essential value in an era of mass production and instant gratification.</strong></p>

<p>What we loved most about meeting Rexite’s people was how <strong>they took the raw materials in their hands and shaped them into products of amazing beauty and functionality</strong>. We think it’s fascinating and amazingly spectacular to let you know about people who worked on your piece of Rexite furniture, people who put all their passion into an order to make it perfect for you.</p>
