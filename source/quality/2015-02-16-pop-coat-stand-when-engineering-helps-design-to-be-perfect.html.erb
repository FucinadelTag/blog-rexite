<p class="abstract">If you find a Pop Coat Stand by chance in someone’s office or distractedly hang your coat on one, it may not occur to you that Pop is actually an example of refined engineering and that several hands have worked to make it just perfect. </p>

<p>We already know about <a href="http://blog.rexite.it/products/2015-01-09-its-time-for-pop.html">Raul Barbieri&#39;s inspiration</a> for the Pop Coat Stand, and we were already told about the advanced technique of gas-assisted injection molding employed to produce the hooks and about its complex process and advantages. But seeing is believing, so <strong>we followed every step of Pop’s production</strong> in order to understand its complexities.  </p>

<p></p>

<p>“What’s the first thing to do when you have to produce a Pop Coat Stand?” we ask. Maurizio, the supervisor of the molding department, is really happy to give us some lessons about coloring and molding plastics and doesn’t mind spending his time helping a couple of inexperienced people like us, so he answers, “When we want to create a product, like the Pop Coat Stand, <strong>we create the single elements separately</strong>: the head, the smaller hooks, the rod and the base. Today we are producing the head, where you hang coats and jackets. First of all, we need the polymer, meaning plastic granules. They are completely transparent, but if we add a liquid coloring paste to the polymer and insert it in the machine barrel, the result is a perfectly colored polymer.” To our surprise, the material is not covered with a layer of colored paint. <strong>It&#39;s the same color all the way through</strong>. You could scratch the whole outer surface off (even if I really could see no point in it), and you would always see the same color. “Then the colored material is put inside a mold,” continues Maurizio, “and the mold gives the shape we desire to the material.” Every single element of every single item made by Rexite is created using huge molds, and putting together these elements, <strong>we have the shapes of unique design</strong>. “As the product gets out of the mold, it’s really warm, and this could cause a deformation of its shape! We fixed this problem by leaving the product in a container full of water to cool off. Then our hooks are ready for the next step: the assembly of all the elements.”</p>

<p>We would now like to invite you to see some of these steps with your own eyes and meet Maurizio, our guide through the production of the Pop Coat Stand. <a href="http://eu.rexitestore.com/coat-stands/208-appendiabiti-da-terra.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=articolo%20blog&utm_campaign=Pop%20Coat%20Stand%3A%20when%20engineering%20helps%20design%20to%20be%20perfect">Pop Coat Stands are available</a> in several different colors in order to fit your house or office!<br></p>
