<p>A honoris causa degree in Visual Arts for Enzo Mari – On June 17th, 2015, the Art Academy of Brera in Milan, Italy, offered an honoris causa degree to master of Italian design Enzo Mari. “How will I celebrate this day? I’ll smoke a Tuscan cigar,” he said with his usual potent sense of humor. Through his studies and experiments on industrial products, Mari has distanced himself from the concept of design as creating mere objects of beauty: <strong>the design object must be functional and useful in its environment</strong>. In fact, he described his work as “constructed in a way that corresponds entirely with the purpose or function of the project.” Alessandro Mendini, an Italian designer and architect who attended the celebration, when talking about Enzo Mari, affirmed that he “is the conscience of us all, the conscience of designers.”<br>No wonder Brera Academy was more than honored to give Enzo Mari, who is Milanese by adoption, the honoris causa degree.</p>

<p>When asked whether there is a place in Milan that is really precious to him, Enzo Mari would answer, “Brera, and not only for the academy,” as he said to a journalist from Corriere della Sera. “Immediately after the war, my family and I lived in via Solferino 5, on the fourth floor, in only two rooms. Many problems and no money. We were really poor.” In the Brera district one can see the bohemian atmosphere that radiates from the famous Art Academy of Fine Arts and throughout the entire area, which takes its name from it. Since his youth, Mari has seen those weirdly dressed artists coming from and going to the Art Academy. In the early ‘50s, <strong>at the age of 18, he attended the academy himself</strong>, focusing on research into the methodology of design.</p>

<p>Following the same research on functionality, <strong>Enzo Mari designed and realized Teca in 1994</strong>. Teca is a multi-level shelving system for positioning on wall-mounted uprights as a bookshelf. For every space and use, Teca is one of several design products conceived and made by Enzo Mari to best represent his quest for function and beauty. Modern and elegant, Teca is easily adaptable to the decor of several rooms. In the living room, Teca is a simple and essential bookcase to store your books. In the kitchen, you can use Teca shelves instead of kitchen cabinets and create a pantry of the size you like.<br>Since 2012, Rexite has been producing Teca by Enzo Mari, available from the <a href="http://eu.rexitestore.com/129-teca?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=articolo%20blog&utm_campaign=teca%20laurea%20honoris%20Mari">online store</a>.</p>

<p>Mari has gathered several prestigious awards over the last decades, including four Compasso d’Oro prizes for conceiving some of the most emblematic pieces of design furniture of the 20th century.</p>
