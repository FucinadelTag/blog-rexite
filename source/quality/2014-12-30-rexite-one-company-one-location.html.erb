<p class="abstract">Since 1968, Rexite has taken up the challenge and decided to stay in the city and the country where everything started, to actually be made in Italy.</p>

<p>How important is it for “Made-in-Italy” products to actually be made in Italy? The spatial division between design and production can, and does, create problems: a loss of information in the productive process and even a loss of technical skills and innovative abilities. But Rexite doesn’t run this risk since its district-based production gives it the chance to exercise full control over production and limit response time in case of changes or special requests from customers.</p>

<p>At Rexite, every phase of production is based in Cusago, near Milan. The injection molding of all plastic materials - meaning the process used to produce parts by injecting material into a mold – and all metal cutting and bending are made by Rexite. The staff takes care of every phase up to assembly and packaging. In other words, the life of a product is followed from the beginning to the end, and only finishing touches can be made outside Rexite: this may include painting, chromium plating, anodization, or the production of particular components, like glass or laminated surfaces. That’s not all: Rexite builds its own molds and develops prototypes and research. </p>

<p>All right, but what are the benefits? Who cares if a product is made in China, Hungary or Italy? We care! We want to maintain control over the quality of products we are producing and that you are receiving. Here is an example: the creation of the Pop coat stand was very demanding. Pop is produced using an injection molding process, but with an innovative process, that requires the coinjection of nitrogen. Several mold attempts have been made by the tool department to obtain the perfect mold and, of course, the perfect stand coat. None of this would have been possible if the production and design department weren’t working side by side, explaining to each other the obstacles of the process. As said, innovation arises from the close contact between producers and designers.</p>

<p>At Rexite, we believe in what we do, as much today as on the first day. We think that people who know their abilities and value them can strive for a bigger future.</p>
