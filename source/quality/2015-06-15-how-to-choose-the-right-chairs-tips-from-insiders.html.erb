<p>In this sea of choices, how can you match your chairs to your table? Don’t worry. There&#39;s the perfect chair out there for you! If you follow a few simple rules, you will see how the wide range of choices can be narrowed down. Often a chair might be suitable for your kitchen but still not for your living room. As well, a chair designed for the office might not be good for a restaurant. But some chairs, due to their traits and features, will find a perfect place in a kitchen or a living room.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Over the last few years, chairs have been more often bought separately from tables, rather than simply being bundled as a ready-made set. Compulsory matches are often not permitted, which can give rooms a creative design.  In this way chairs can be different from tables in terms of colors and materials, but <strong>try to keep the styles fairly similar so the chairs work with your table</strong>. For instance, for a very linear single-color table, you can match it with very unique chairs, maybe in contrast to the line and color; if you want instead to put the focus on the table, then you should choose very linear chairs, maybe even transparent ones whose value is limited to their usability. Before buying your chairs, the first thing to do is measure your current table or future one. In fact, you need to consider the <strong>height difference between the seat height and the table</strong>. For instance, if your  table is about 74–76 cm high, your chair height (from the floor to the seat) should generally be about 45–47 cm, in order to allow 30 cm between the seat of the chair and the tabletop. </p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/rexite/b75b9f6c4dbef1c818adfbc4e9bd873ed8070f67_sedie.png" alt="" width="1000" height="309" /></p>

<p>Also, consider the total height of the chair: it should not be more than 90 cm, since movement in the kitchen, office or restaurant is fast and frequent and a high seatback can be an annoying obstacle. Moreover, no one likes chairs that are too heavy. You should also pay specific <strong>attention to the choice of materials</strong>. They need to be practical, wholesome, and easy to clean. So think about plastic materials or synthetic, stain-resistant fabrics. In addition, the smaller the environment, the smaller the chairs, which could also be folding or stackable.</p>

<p>Among design objects, chairs are ones where designers are free to explore their creativity. 4 chairs can create a comfortable and inviting dining room, a cool and distinctive restaurant, a funtional and welcoming office: is there any other piece of furniture that can do the same?</p>
