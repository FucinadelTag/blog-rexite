<p><strong>Rino Pirovano and Rino Boschet met at the end of the 1970s and from that moment on, the history of Rexite began.</strong> Rino Pirovano was the grandchild of an engineer, and his father worked as a sale agent for famous Italian companies exporting in Far East countries. Rino Boschet was the son of a carpenter from Venice and was inspired by a strong passion for mechanics.</p>

<p>Since that meeting, their friendship became stronger and luckier. While Pirovano was naturally keen on commerce, Rino Boschet had a marked passion for mechanics: <strong>a perfect duo ready to make something really special.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Their meeting led to the audacious purchase of a little workshop held by the widow of an old artisan</strong>, thanks to the effort of Pirovano and Boschet they paid all of the mortgage promissory notes through hard sacrifices. The old artisan had been a pioneering innovator in the production of the plastic components of motorcycles and scooters, so Pirovano and Boschet became the new owners of the specific equipment, including two old printing presses, a lathe, a milling machine and an old drill.</p>

<p><strong>It was a legendary era</strong>: Rino Boschet was making plates using the lathe and the milling machine, while Rino Pirovano was taking care of the production with the printing press and the slice, rushing to deliver invoices written with his old typewriter, â€œOlivetti Lettera 22".
</p>

<p>Their initiative and commitment, besides the production of motorcycle and scooter replacement parts for companies like Guzzi, Gilera, Vespa and Lambretta, led them to the <strong>production of metal and plastic components</strong> related to diverse business sectors including air conditioning filters, oil industry valves, replacement parts of cars, little household devices and much more.
