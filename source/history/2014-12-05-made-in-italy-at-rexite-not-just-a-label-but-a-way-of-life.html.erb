<p>‘Made in Italy’ is an extremely valuable label. It is <strong>synonymous with quality, creativity and design</strong>. From fashion to the manufacturing of shoes, from interior design to inventions and research, Made in Italy makes us stand out in the world. However, we must say that these 3 words have too often been used to identify products that have little to do with Italy. As a result, very few companies can proudly say that both their design and production are entirely made in Italy - 100% Made in Italy. Here at Rexite Made in Italy is not just a synonym of “Produced in Italy”; rather, it means the extraordinary and patient work that stands behind a chair, a pencil cup or a wall clock. <strong>Here at Rexite Made in Italy means passion and tradition.</strong> Made in Italy means real people. This is what has made Rexite famous all over the world.</p>

<p>From the moment Rexite saw the light way back in 1968, the company established itself in Cusago, a small town near Milan. Since then, designers and manufacturers have been working side by side, with thoroughly-tested teamwork. This is the way Rexite was born, the way it grew with time and the way it still operates. Here designers create their products, or works of art, as we should call them. They conceive an idea by carefully exploring the world around them, and find inspiration snooping behind the surface appearance of things. They are real craftsman, as they make their sketches again and again until they have found the perfect harmony of lines and shapes. <strong>Attention to each and every detail and meticulously selected materials are crucial moments before the production. </strong></p>

<p>After that, our trained manufacturers come on the scene. It’s now their turn to make the sketches real: what has been a mere idea till now will soon became a perfect, tangible product. Their experienced hands are helped by continuous technological research that allows Rexite to keep up with innovative competitors. Each product is then carefully controlled to maintain the highest quality materials and production processes, so as to build trust with customers.
<strong>Simplicity, respect for tradition and teamwork are the heart of Rexite.</strong> Each of our products tells a story: the story of a designer and its commitment, the enduring, daily work of our local manufacturers, the respect for each other. In few words, the work as a team, the work as an Italian family.</p>
