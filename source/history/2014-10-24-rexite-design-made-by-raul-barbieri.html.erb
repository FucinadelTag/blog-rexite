<p>The design career path of Raul Barbieri starts well before his arrival in Rexite. During his studies he was working at Sottsass’ studio, one of the leading icons of 70’s Italian design, where he was involved with the improvement of Olivetti’s projects.</p>

<p>Rino Pirovano met Raul Barbieri during a meeting with a company that manufactured lamps: Pirovano provided them some of the components, while Barbieri was their designer. As soon as Raul found out about Rino Pirovano and Boschet’s talent in making molds, molding plastic, and cutting metal, he became extremely passionate about their works and offered them a partnership. Raul<strong> began to design specific items that could be easily produced by Pirovano and Boschet.</strong></p>

<p>The improvement of technique and the knowledge of metal production, as well as metal and plastic molding, led the young partners to an awareness of their technical and productive skills.</p>

<p><strong>The first item Raul Barbieri designed and submitted to Rexite was a table ashtray with a pierced cover, named Safe Tray and conceived in 1977</strong> - at that time it was still possible to smoke in closed public spaces and means of transport. <br></p>

<p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/rexite/b1f129f7a131625dcbf634f0c72a8ded77115eab_01-safe-tray-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></p>

<p><br>They worked hard to mix together Rexite technologies, such as plastic injection molding, metal molding and cutting, and the result was outstanding. This item was made of an engineering polymer base and an aluminum grill. The perfect union for the company of Cusago: a simple, cheap item that could be easily delivered through Rexite’s means.</p>

<p>Since that first piece, <strong>they started producing several design items, all linked by a subtle leitmotiv that would be Rexite’s motto ever since: simple yet not banal, original yet not bizarre.</strong> After Safe Tray, they understood that making single items wasn’t enough, but a complete set of desk devices needed to be conceived. Therefore, Rexite joined the world of modern office and furniture tools.</p>

<p>Since then, Raul Barbieri began to plan an entire desk set, named “Babele”, composed of several items, including a letter tray, a desk pad, a pencil tray, a pencil cup, a memo pad holder and a letter rack.</p>

<p>At Rexite, designers and producers work closely together to ease their jobs: in order to create appropriate molds, Raul Barbieri had to design simple and well-refined lines, while production operators check the efficiency and practicality of the items. <strong>Dedicated teamwork between departments that aims to create perfect and efficient items. This is what Made in Italy is made of.</strong><br></p>
