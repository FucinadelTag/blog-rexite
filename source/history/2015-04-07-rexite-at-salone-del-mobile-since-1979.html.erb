<p><strong>Rexite’s presence at Salone del Mobile is anything but recent</strong>, and we were there even when the famous exhibition used to be held at the old stands, now demolished, where the residential skyscrapers of CityLife now rise. During our first two years at Salone del Mobile, we didn’t manage to get a proper stand; instead, we only managed to secure a crystal window of nearly 1 m x 2 m. Even though small, our window was in a very strategic position in the main corridor, where all the big brands were:  Kartell, Zanotta, Poltrona Frau, Castelli, Arflex, and Bernini. Such a sought-after and exclusive spot was known as the “Olympus,” due to the quality and number of visitors, as well as to the top floor location reserved for design.</p>

<p>At that time, our items mainly were top desk accessories, waste baskets, and umbrella stands, so we fit perfectly into the limited space of our window. We even managed to showcase umbrella stands and waste baskets outside the window, like on a pedestal, to draw more visitors! Rino Pirovano still remembers his embarrassment and the nasty looks he got from the nearby stands, “I felt like an illicit ice cream man in front of the best patisseries of the town, but the great number of contacts we found balanced out our discomfort, including spending the entire day on our feet!”. And the miraculous effect of the “ice cream man’s window” was not long in coming. We soon came into contact with buyers from the most famous American department stores: <strong>Macy’s, Bloomingdale, Crate&amp; Barrel, Pottery Barn, and Conran’s</strong>. To our own surprise, they began to order large amounts of our top desk accessories and waste baskets. This is why our Babele letter trays, Slim and Centobuchi pencil cups and trays, Gemini and Duplo bookends, Cribbio and Birillo waste baskets and coat stands spread first on the American market and only later on the Italian one. We soon began to export to international markets: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia and we were really good at it. In fact, even today our export percentage is around 80%!</p>

<p>Why is Salone del Mobile so important and why is it the most keenly awaited event in the world of furniture? Just one figure: 312.000. This is the number of participants who joined Salone del Mobile 2014 in Milan. We can easily understand why Salone del Mobile is unquestionably the most important worldwide design event, able to draw professionals from every part of the world. Since 2015 is an odd year, EuroLuce and Salone Ufficio events will also take place: two more reasons why Salone del Mobile is the unrivalled opportunity for interaction between architects, vendors, interior designers and design magazine authors who want to keep up with worldwide design. Since <strong>Rexite exports 80% of its production to international markets</strong>, Salone del Mobile means we will have the chance to meet with our international clientele, show them our new proposals and meet new partners from all over the world. We will be there at Hall 16, B2 with our latest news and <a href="http://eu.rexitestore.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=articolo%20blog&utm_campaign=Rexite%20at%20Salone%20del%20Mobile%2C%20since%201979">our best products ever</a>.<br></p>
