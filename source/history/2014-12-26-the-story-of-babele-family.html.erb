<p>The head of house Babele, meaning the first item to be conceived, is the <strong>ashtray Safetray</strong>. Back in the seventies, ashtrays were considered basic necessities as the number of people smoking was really striking. At that time, e-commerce was still locked inside the mind of some computer geniuses, and Rino Pirovano drew near market as an off-the-cuff peddler! Several furniture showrooms closed the door on him. All but one: Tecno in via Montenapoleone. After checking the quality and design of Safetray, Tecno asked Pirovano if there were other desktop accessories to be matched with the astray. Pirovano couldn’t believe his ears. He immediately rushed back and asked Barbieri Architect to conceive a set of accessories, a family, to match with the Safetray. Here is the story of how Babele was born.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since that first lucky Safetray, <strong>the skillful hand of Raul Barbieri quickly gave light to the Babele desktop series</strong>. A memo pad holder, a letter tray, a pencil cup and a desk pad with pencil tray are the other members of the family. They all have a distinctive feature in common: the piercing of the engineering polymer. This pierced design gave them a technological look, and a je ne sais quoi of lightness. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Where does the name come from? What does the Tower of Babel have in common with design desktop accessories? Sure, there is a reason for it! The desktop set is named after another historical accessory of the family, a letter tray designed in 1980, also by Barberi. Well, thanks to their stability, letter trays can be piled up neatly. Just like a real tower! From here, recall the name. What about the enlightenment behind the letter tray? Even here, there is a curious story to tell. Think about a multi-level car park: wouldn’t it be much easier to find your car if every floor were marked by a color to identify and remember it? This is what Barbieri was thinking about before conceiving the letter tray: colored-trays to quickly identify all of your documents.</p>

<p>We may ask ourselves how can a desktop series still be sold after more than thirty years. <strong>Babele doesn’t answer to fashion crushes. Its design is evergreen: classic, elegant, functional</strong>. Just like a desktop series should be.</p>
