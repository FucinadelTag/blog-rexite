<p><strong>The history of Rexite, based in Cusago (Milan), begins at the end of 70&#39;</strong>, when Rino Pirovano, the grandchild of an engineer and the son of a sale agent of famous Italian factories for the far east market, met Rino Boschet, the son of a venetian carpenter gifted with a terrific passion for mechanics. </p>

<p>From that moment on, their friendship became stronger and luckier. While Pirovano was naturally keen on commerce, Rino Boschet had a marked passion for mechanics:<strong> a perfect duo ready to make something really special.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The magic meeting of these two dreamers led to the signature of several long-time promissory notes</strong> on monthly notice, all paid with hard sacrifices, that aimed to the audacious purchase of a little workshop held by the widow of an old artisan. The latter was a pioneer in the press of plastic for spare parts of motorcycles and scooters. Pirovano and Boschet will become the new owners of specific equipment, like two old printing presses, a lathe, a milling machine and an old drill.</p>

<p><strong>It was a legendary era</strong>: Rino Boschet made plates, use the lathe and milling machine, whereas Rino Pirovano took care of the production on the press and on the slice, hurrying up to deliver invoices written with his old â€œOlivetti lettera 22", sometimes with an old pedal tricycle with an expansive loaded level!</p>

<p>Their initiative and their commitment, besides the production of motorcycles and scooters replacement parts for companies like Guzzi, Gilera, Vespa and Lambretta, also led them to the production of technical components<strong> in metal e plastic</strong> related to diversified business sectors: air conditioning filters, oil industry valves, parts of cars, little household devices and much more.
