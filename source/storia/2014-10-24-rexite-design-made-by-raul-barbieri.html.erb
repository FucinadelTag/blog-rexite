<p>Thanks to the improvement of technique and the knowledge of metal production, as well as metal and plastic molding, our young partners became aware of their technical and productive skills.</p>

<p><strong>One day, while Rino Pirovano was going to a meeting with one of his customers who made design lamps that supplied metal elements, he met Raul Barbieri.</strong> </p>

<p>At the time Raul Barbieri worked with Giorgio Marianelli. Raul used to work at Sottsass’ studio, one of the best representatives of the 70’s Italian design, where he was working on the improvement of Olivetti’s projects.</p>

<p>As Raul found out about Rino Pirovano and his friend’s talent in making plates, molding plastic and cutting metal, he became interested in their job, so he offered them a partnership. He designed some products that could be easily made out to the Pirovano-Boschet factory. </p>

<p><strong>The first item Raul Barbieri designed and submitted to Rexite was an ashtray, named Safe Tray, conceived in 1977</strong>.

<p>
It was a table ashtray, with a pierced cover; at the time it was still possible to smoke in closed spaces, publics, home and on means of transport. </p>

<p><strong>It was made of an engineering polymer base and an aluminum grill. The perfect union for the company of Cusago: a simple, cheap item that could be simply delivered through Rexite’s means.</strong> </p>

<p>The simplicity and accuracy of the item had hidden some problems that designers and production experts had to face. Designers and producers work really close to ease their jobs: in order to create appropriate plates, Raul Barbieri had to design easy but well-finished lines, while production operators had to check the efficiency and practicality.</p>

<p><strong>After the first design product, Safe Tray, they understood that making single articles wasn’t enough, but a complete set of desk devices needed to be conceived. Therefore, Rexite joined the world of modern office and furniture tools.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As a result Raul Barbieri began to plan an entire desk set, named “Babele”, composed of several items, including a letter tray, a desk pad, a pencil tray, a pencil cup, a memo pad holder and a letter rack.</strong>
