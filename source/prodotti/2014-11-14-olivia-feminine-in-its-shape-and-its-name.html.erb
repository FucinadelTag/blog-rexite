<p>How was born a design product, like Olivia?</p>

<p>The creation process of a design product is always unusual, often random. The inspiration comes from art, nature, our own experience, objects and people around. There isn't just a primary specific research but also a creative effort. </p>

<p><strong>The starting points of Olivia chair were three: the guitar, the female figure and the Well Stool Rexite.</strong></p>

<p>Raul Barbieri, her creator, was inspired by the shape of a guitar, because it was sexy, sinuous, soft, young and has an irresistible design. He would have liked to be able to play it, to hold it in his hands and beholding it.
In the history of art, the female figure has always been a central theme. For example in the “Guitar” paint by Picasso, one of the first experiments of composition accomplished by the “papier collè” technique, it represents the astonishing and unwitting Olivia’s “Stylistic manifesto”.</p>

<p>In the creation of Olivia, the shape of the seat of Well stool represents another starting idea.
<strong>His seat is very wavy, curved like the feminine figure and like the profile of a guitar, for that reason Raul decided to propose again this rounded line</strong>. </p>

<p>The new chair would have been the development of this stackable stool. </p>

<p>Therefore he decided to add a seatback to the stool, so<strong> </strong>that<strong> there will have been a chair composed by a stool and a backrest</strong>. 
In planning, he used a lot of model prototype like sketches, scale mock-up (cardboard and expanded polystyrene), from little scale prototype to mock-up in pasted cardboard with a specific technique that permits to represent any form.

<p>After many technical and style tests, Raul was successful in defining the Olivia’s shape. A unique wavy piece that mixes seatback and seat, as he wanted it, feminine and sensual.</p>
